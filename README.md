# PR/management for social media

This project was built in Java and the main idea behind it was to make it easier to manage multiple influencers/celebrities.

## Features
- Database connection
- User interface (JavaFX)
- Growth calculators for influencers, creating/ deleting new influencers, scheduling posts

## Future implementations
I want to continue developing this project by working on the user interface and by adding a report generator for the growth of each influencer.
